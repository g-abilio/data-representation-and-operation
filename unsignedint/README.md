# Storing unsigned integers

Unsigned integers are stored in the computer as a binary pattern, which will be bounded to the memory location used in the storage.

All types of data are transformed into a uniform representation when stored in the computer, and are transformed back to their original format when retrieved. This universal representation is called a binary standard.

**Binary pattern** is a chain of bits, e.g. a 16 bits binary standard is composed of 16 0s and 1s.

This project shows how unsigned integers are stored and represented in a computer. Also, memory and its consequences on the storing will be exhibited.
